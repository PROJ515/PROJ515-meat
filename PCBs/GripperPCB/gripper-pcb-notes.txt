3mm white LED
â€¢	Forward voltage of 3.3V and a forward current of 30mA (assumed)
Will drive in parallel

5vs 

(5 - 3.3)/0.03 = 56 ohm

total current = 0.03*4 = 120mA


driver for 4 LEDs
breakout for micro
servo breakout (8 servos)
teensy (prolly 3.2)
bbreakout for remaining ADCs, DACs, maybe comms etc...
small rectangular footprint (1:2)
current sensor x4
